Zipf's law
----------

Zipf's law is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics. The law is named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who first proposed it. Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.
